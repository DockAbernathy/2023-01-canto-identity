Hello. Where uses event CIDNFTAdded? Do you have website, which check these events.. or some other logic?


[02/01/2023 10:49] Lambda#9382
Currently, they are not used anywhere. But yes, the idea is that frontends or other off-chain components can consume these

thankyou

hello! where can we find more info about the different AssociationTypes? (when/why should you enable an association when registering a subprotocol)


[02/01/2023 15:16] Lambda#9382
By choosing the association type, you can control how your subprotocol can/will be used. For instance, let's imagine there is a subprotocol that represents friends (so each NFT of the subprotocol would be a friend). You could in theory register that with the three different types, which would change the meaning of the association:
- PRIMARY: You can have exactly one (or zero) friends. Probably not very sensible, but in that case it could represent "My best friend" for instance
- ORDERED: You can have many friends and they are ordered. That would be like the top 8 friends on MySpace back in the day
- ACTIVE: You can have many friends and they are not ordered. This is the classical social media model that Facebook & co. uses

Hey! Is there any documentation apart from the one in the contest info?


[02/01/2023 17:01] Lambda#9382
The docs folder in the repo also contains some documentation, but that's mostly autogenerated based off the natspec comments. If anything is unclear, feel free to ask


[02/02/2023 06:41] nameruse#6452
Hi! for ordered association, is the key value in the ordered mapping representing the order of the association?


[02/02/2023 09:46] Lambda#9382
Yes exactly

hard to find H/M for this one. I will be happy if one of mine can be counted


[02/21/2023 08:38] heuss
you guys do some report without being sure they are valid ?


[02/21/2023 13:12] dadekuma
sometimes they are invalid even if you think that they are valid 😢


[02/21/2023 13:20] chaduke3730
@Heuss The one I found has a fine line, you can read it in both ways. For me, I strongly believe it is a H/M, but I am not the judge.


[02/21/2023 14:26] heuss
i see


[02/21/2023 14:51] matin6517
Glad to hear that one could find a high.
I found a problem in listeners and DApp side thus I marked as low. But a sweety low😅.
Wish to be accepted


[02/23/2023 13:36] devabdee
Any update? We can expect the results at the end of Feb!? 🙂

ohno 

[03/07/2023 11:13] Lambda#9382
Hey, yes I did not see a reason for restricting that, but changed my mind after seeing some PoC's and discussing it internally. See also my comment on the issue:
> I first thought that this is intended behaviour because the same identity/person can have multiple wallets. But after seeing the examples in the findings and discussing this internally, it will be changed such that registrations are removed on transfer.


[03/07/2023 11:51] .nalus
And what did the POC's show that made you change your mind? They only show that the NFT is transferred to another user... I would expect if a judge says something is wanted behavior, it is a fact not a matter of opinion.


[03/07/2023 11:52] .nalus
So my lesson here is to never listen to judges and just submit everything just in case?


[03/07/2023 12:01] Lambda#9382
Mainly the fact that it can be abused to circumvent fees and may be problematic with certain integrations, e.g. reward systems. But I am not a judge, you are right that the assessment of the judge ultimately decides the severity and validity. If you think something is truly a bug/vulnerability and can write a PoC/scenario where it leads to problems for it, I would recommend to submit it for two reasons:
1.) Your PoC may convince the sponsor that the current implementation is not ideal
2.) Even if a sponsor disputes a finding, the judge may still deem it valid. If you look at historical reports, there are a few such cases.


[03/08/2023 11:41] xariextz
When will be the rewards shown?

maybe the primary report multiplier just offset the med issue, idk, just asking


[03/16/2023 20:20] nine_k
thanks for raising! will let @🦙 liveactionllama | C4 take a look or pass to the correct person for help 🙂


[03/16/2023 20:47] liveactionllamac4
Yeah, I had noticed that too, but, as you mentioned, it just seems to be a coincidence due to the offset from the primary report multiplier.
